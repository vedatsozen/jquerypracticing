# jquerypracticing
I made some jquery practices.
I created 3 divs.
In first div, there is a button that opens a text and closes it.
It is a toggle button made by jquery.

In second div there is a photo slider. 
You can slide and see other photos.

In third div, there is small photos that you can make them as background photo.
